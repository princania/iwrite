The sky was blude, filled with shades of dark clouds. Wind rushing through my ears. 
I could see the roads, filled with vehicles, some movies fast, some moving slow.
There we green tress and green grasses all over the fields, showering in tiny droplets falling from the sky.
I could see neon lights all over the streets, some red, some white, some green and some yellow, all trying to grab your attention.

I could see the leaves swinging in the air, the Indian Flag roaring high in the sky.
I could see a milk man, delivering milk.
I could see no birds on the sky, the only creature on the skies where the bats, using their biological sonar systems to navigate themselves through the empty sky. 

My body was calm, I sat in peace in the cold iron stairs, admiring the world around me,, trying to describe what I saw and felt through words. There where tiny droplets of water on my screen.

There were times, when I could see no man on the street. The only moving things I could see were leaves, and cars. Everything else was still on the cold night.
