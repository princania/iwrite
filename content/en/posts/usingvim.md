description: This is about my experience with IDEs, comparing some of the one's I have used and justifying the statement

Over the years I have tried multiple IDEs, ranging from Notepad to Atom and VS Code. I mean those are great IDEs, but platform depended (You see where I'm going). Let's start with the basics.
Notepad : Boring, makes the person using it become frustrated. This is exactly what you give a newbie, who just started programming, so that he starts hating it (and say things like "programming is not really my cup of tea"). I mean the very first thing to hate about notepad is it's white background, second is it's disgusting font (I can go on and on). 
Atom : Honestly, not bad. I decided to give it a shot just because Angela Yu. told me to do (An awesome instructor in a Udemy Course). Simple and Efficient, less features by the way.
VS Code : Well we all have tried it, extensions, themes, default dark theme, it's good.
Vim : I understand, you really like VS Code, millions of extensions, auto complete, code snippets, boilerplates, and what not. I will compare it to my couch, soft, comfortable, I could sleep on, but the thing is I can't take my couch to the beach, or to a trip with my friends or to my college. Now Vim, I would compare it to a foldable chair. You like VS code, but the thing is you won't get to always code in your computer, and you definitely can't go around installing VS Code on every system you ever had to work on, what about when you quickly need to change something in your server, now you see where I'm getting at. The easy of just editing things without even leaving your terminal, not only is it quick, makes you a better programmer (by not letting you get dependent on auto-completion and boilerplates) but also looks cool. I mean I had to hire a programmer, and one of them used Vim, I would choose him. Now I'm not going to teach you each command, there's plenty of tutorials out there, but I feel like you could do a lot more that what you could on a VS Code, you have different mode's you can choose from (number line, find, find and replace, jump 3 rows, append, delete the entire line), plus It does support indentation (unlike notepad), and a terminal with some level of transparency is just wow!. Here are some memes for you to enjoy.
