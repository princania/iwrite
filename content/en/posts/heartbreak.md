The Earth has Existed for the past 4.5 Billion Years, Life on Earth first occurred 3.7 billion years ago.
The question arises
{{< alert theme="danger" dir="ltr" >}} # How did we came into existence ?
**Easiest Answer** : God Created it.
**Scientific Answer** : Evolution.
**God mixed with Science** : God created some building block, or fundamental elements of nature and from there on, evolution did its job.
{{< /alert >}} 
{{< boxmd >}}
Total Number of Species that have lived on this Earth : **More than 1 Trillion**
Number  of species we humans have identified and studied : **1.8 Million**
{{< /boxmd >}}
Keeping the above numbers in mind (it helps giving a clear picture), lets move forward with the story. 
So **Primates**, our ancestors ("Our" refers to "Homo Sapiens") where first seen **12 Million** years ago. These primates, later in future evolved (I don't really remember the exact numbers, you can google such factual data) into two main categories, Apes and A group of species that could walk in two legs, namely Australopithecus and Neanderthal. This is where the magic happens, Primates now had longer sight on ground, due to more height (they could stand now), and most importantly, they had two limbs that they no longer use to walk. However there were a lot of disadvantages to this as well, these two legged species were a very easy prey for predators, that was a threat to their survival. So these species did what every other living organism would have done when presented with a threat to their existence, they evolved to take counter-measures, and how did they counter-measure this situation, they developed their cognitive abilities.

Fast forward to **2.5 Million** years ago, those primates evolved to Homo habilis, the closest ancestors to Homo Sapiens. And about **300 Thousand** Years ago, Homo Sapiens came into existence.

I will update this story later in the future. (POV : I could be wrong about the facts.)
