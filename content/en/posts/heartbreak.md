The Earth has Existed for the past 4.5 Billion Years, Life on Earth first occurred 3.7 billion years ago.
The question arises
{{< alert theme="danger" dir="ltr" >}} # How did we came into existence ?
**Easiest Answer** : God Created it.
**Scientific Answer** : Evolution.
**God mixed with Science** : God created some building block, or fundamental elements of nature and from there on, evolution did its job.

Total Number of Species that have lived on this Earth : **More than 1 Trillion**
Number  of species we humans have identified and studied : **1.8 Million**
{{< /boxmd >}}
Keeping the above numbers in mind (it helps giving a clear picture), lets move forward with the story. 
So **Primates**, our ancestors ("Our" refers to "Homo Sapiens") where first seen **12 Million** years ago. These primates, later in future evolved (I don't really remember the exact numbers, you can google such factual data) into two main categories, Apes and A group of species that could walk in two legs, namely Australopithecus and Neanderthal. This is where the magic happens, Primates now had longer sight on ground, due to more height (they could stand now), and most importantly, they had two limbs that they no longer use to walk. However there were a lot of disadvantages to this as well, these two legged species were a very easy prey for predators, that was a threat to their survival. So these species did what every other living organism would have done when presented with a threat to their existence, they evolved to take counter-measures, and how did they counter-measure this situation, they developed their cognitive abilities.

Fast forward to **2.5 Million** years ago, those primates evolved to Homo habilis, the closest ancestors to Homo Sapiens. And about **300 Thousand** Years ago, Homo Sapiens came into existence. From there on we have been surviving, hunting, reproducing, this and that, but nothing special.
**70,000**(obviously these numbers are round figures) years ago, Neolithic Revolution happened, humans had learnt the art of agriculture, they has discovered the fact about how plants grew from a tiny seed. Before this, humans livid in colonies, living in one place and using it's resources, and ounce this resources are over they moved on to a new place, or they had a group of men who went out and brought food for the entire colony. But in the Neolithic Revolution, these humans need not worry about the basic needs anymore. They had fulfilled there physiological needs (Moslow's Law of human needs(I'm bad with spellings)). For the first time in the history of man kind, humans had more food then they needed, so now they didn't have anything to do, they no longer needed to worry about food or shelter. Life was set for them (in laymen terms). That's when they allowed their curiosity to take about. They stated questioning things "Why did the sun always rise from that side", "Where is the water coming from", "why this why that", that's when the first group of philosophers came into existences. People who think and question things, people who's hunger of answers was more prominent then their hunger for food.

From there on, asking questions, finding answers, categorizing things, differentiating things started. And as one category grew bigger and bigger it developed into a separate subject, for example things related to physical world, become physics, questions and answers related to biological beings became biology, and then sub-categories such as zoology and botany. That's the reason Philosophy it is called the mother of all subjects.

I will update this story later in the future. (POV : I could be wrong about the facts.)
