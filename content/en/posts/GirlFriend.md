description: Just my preference on girls.

There are lot of things that I wanted to do, but couldn't due to the lack of resources (resources not just in terms of materialistic things, but also time), For Example, Guitar, I even bought a guitar during my Diploma days, I even joined Guitar classes, but couldn't continue due to my college (I feel like I'm just giving excuses). I really wanted to learn guitar and play awesome songs for myself. Another thing I really wanted to pursue was Chess. Man I spent a lot of time playing it, just to ultimately realize, you can't have everything. You need to sacrifice some less important things for the more important ounce (coding). 

Anyways, back to the topic. I want someone to fill in those gaps. I don't want someone who has a lot similarities with me, I want a girl who has a different taste than mine. However I will prefer girls who know to play guitar or is an expert in any other form of Art. This phrase was not meant to be used by guys, but it is a big turn on for me.

Someone who can play a guitar.
Someone who isn't concerned about what other people thing about them.
Must be good looking. (good looking for me not fair girls or girls with big tits, but rather who like to stay clean and hygienic, has good dressing sense, good hair done. Qualities that are not hereditary but rather learnt).
