Hello! I'm Prem. I'm a CS Student from a third class Diploma College (Third class in terms of education quality, infrastructure, administration, etc. Trust me I can go on and on). I hobbies include playing chess (text me and we can compete in chess.com), going out to movies and dinner alone (mostly, and not because I don't have friends, I have a lot of wonderful friends, but I like to vibe alone), coding (takes up 20% of my waking hours).

I like to read story books (yes, I'm still a kid in my taste of books, books from Roald Dahl (sorry if I misspelled his name)). I also like to listen to music (EDM, and some Hindi Chill). Apart from these, I occasionally like to design UIs in Figma.
